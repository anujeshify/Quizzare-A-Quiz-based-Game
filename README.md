# Quizzare - A Quiz based Game

This quiz game system is developed for users who are interested in playing an interactive quiz game containing set of questions and their corresponding answers. The users will be given a set of options to choose from on each difficulty level. The questions will be segregated into different levels of difficulty. It will be users’ choice to choose the level of difficulty and according to that level of difficulty, questions will be displayed. There will also be points for each question, which will increase with each correct answer and it will be different for different levels of difficulty. For example, a hard question will have more points than an easy question. User will be awarded points for each correct answer, but for every wrong answer they will not get any points or their points will be deducted. After every round, leader board will be updated and will display name and score of users.

### Project Objectives

* To create an interactive quiz game that is user friendly. The software is capable enough to retrieve questions and corresponding options and check if the answer is correct or not. The software allows interactive user experience.
*  User Interface environment where even standalone users can play the quiz game comfortably and easily. All the data pertaining to the quiz game is kept in the csv file from where it can be easily retrieved, viewed or updated. But, such kind of technical details are hidden from the standalone user. They just need to select the relevant option from the given choices. However, the central repository of data can be easily accessed if required.
* Effective search measures are present in the software from where the user choice is matched with the correct answer.
* The software provides the facility of storing names and score of the userstand also displays the ranks of the previous users in descending order of their scores.
